first argument to getopts is a string for expected options
if an option accepts/requires an argument, a colon follows it
second arg is variable name which will hold the letter option that
is currently being processed


getopts input is processed in a getopts loop/case statement:

while getopts "optionstring" varname; do 
	case "$varname" in
	#) ;;
	#) ;;
	#) ;;
	esac
done

shift $$(( OPTIND - 1 ))

____

all option arguments are storeed in the $OPTARG variable

when using getopts: arguments are passed by using the syntax
filename -flag arg -flag arg 
where the arg is skipped if the option doesn't require input


adding a colon to the BEGINNING of the input string in the script switches error reporting to silent mode (doesn't get oputputted to console)
any unrecognized input will be set to ? and $OPTARG will be set to the inknown character. this is dealt with by adding a \?) case to the case statemtn

to deal with missing arguments: $opt is set to : and $OPTARG will be set ot eh otion that is missing an arg
deal with by using :) in case statement
