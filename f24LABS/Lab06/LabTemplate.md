## Part 2 - Retrospective

1. 
```
getopts is a tool to take in and deal with script-defined arguments. it uses a while loop within the bash script to define the desired options and deal with the input given to those arguments. arguments are passed on the command line when calling the sscript.
```
2.
```
I had to look up a few more resources to understand how to use the getopts while loop, but my case statement was really simple so it wasn't too bad. I got stuck on using sed to change the filename for a while, but reading through the resources helped and I just kept messing with my script until it worked. 
```
3. 
```
I think it would be more useful if it could locate all the files with matching regex within a directory and change them all, like how sed functions for a script.

## Part 3 - namechange Usage Guide

THIS SHOULD ALL BE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH ONLY YOUR USAGE GUIDE TEXT

Examples of script usage and output. This should be enough info that  
you can hand this and the script to someone not in this course and they  
would be able to understand what your script does and how to use it.

Use good markdown so that this documentation is pretty and clean on GitHub.

Bellow is kind of how I would format things

### What it is

Describe your script in plain English, nothing too technical.  Think about this as describing what you made over the dinner table.

### How to run it

If someone wanted to downloaded your script, what steps would they take to have their own copy that they could run
1. Numbers followed by a space
2. Create numeric lists
3. Don't forget `code snips` can go in backticks.

### Examples

```
Two examples using your script to rename an existing file
By using the triple quotes, you can enclose a block of code
And code blocks look very professional
```
